/**
 * Custom Memory Allocator Implementation
 * =======================================
 * 
 * This file implements a free-list based memory allocator that manages a static
 * buffer of memory. This is similar to how malloc/free work internally, but
 * simplified for educational purposes.
 * 
 * KEY CONCEPTS:
 * 
 * 1. HEAP MANAGEMENT:
 *    - We use a large static buffer as our "heap" (1MB in this case)
 *    - The allocator manages this buffer, handing out chunks to callers
 *    - Unlike the real heap, our buffer has a fixed size
 * 
 * 2. BLOCK HEADERS:
 *    - Each allocated/free region has a header that stores metadata
 *    - Headers form a doubly-linked list for traversal
 *    - The header is placed immediately before the user's data
 * 
 * 3. FREE LIST:
 *    - We maintain a linked list of free blocks
 *    - When allocating, we search this list for a suitable block
 *    - When freeing, we add the block back to the free list
 * 
 * 4. FRAGMENTATION:
 *    - External fragmentation: free memory split into small non-contiguous chunks
 *    - We combat this with coalescing: merging adjacent free blocks
 * 
 * 5. ALLOCATION STRATEGIES:
 *    - First-fit: Use the first block that's large enough (our approach)
 *    - Best-fit: Use the smallest block that's large enough
 *    - Worst-fit: Use the largest available block
 * 
 * 6. ALIGNMENT:
 *    - CPUs access memory most efficiently at aligned addresses
 *    - We ensure all returned pointers are 8-byte aligned
 *    - This is crucial for performance and correctness on many architectures
 * 
 * Memory Layout:
 * 
 *    +----------------+------------------+----------------+------------------+
 *    | Block Header 1 | User Data 1      | Block Header 2 | User Data 2      |
 *    +----------------+------------------+----------------+------------------+
 *    ^                ^                  ^                ^
 *    |                |                  |                |
 *    Block start      Returned to user   Next block       Returned to user
 * 
 * Block Header Structure:
 * 
 *    +--------+----------+------+------+
 *    | size   | is_free  | next | prev |
 *    +--------+----------+------+------+
 *    
 *    size:    Total size of user data area (not including header)
 *    is_free: 1 if block is free, 0 if allocated
 *    next:    Pointer to next block in memory (not next free block)
 *    prev:    Pointer to previous block in memory

/**
 * my_realloc - Resize an allocated block
 * 
 * This is our implementation of realloc(). It handles several cases:
 * 
 * 1. ptr == NULL: Equivalent to malloc(size)
 * 2. size == 0: Equivalent to free(ptr), returns NULL
 * 3. Shrinking: May split the block, returns same pointer
 * 4. Growing (fits in place): Returns same pointer
 * 5. Growing (doesn't fit): Allocate new, copy, free old
 * 
 * @param ptr   Pointer to previously allocated memory (or NULL)
 * @param size  New size in bytes
 * @return      Pointer to resized memory, or NULL on failure
 * 
 * Important: If realloc returns NULL (failure), the original block
 * is NOT freed. The caller must handle this to avoid memory leaks.
 * 
 * Usage:
 *     arr = (int *)my_realloc(arr, new_size);
 *     // DANGER: if realloc fails, we've lost the original pointer!
 *     
 *     // Safer pattern:
 *     int *new_arr = (int *)my_realloc(arr, new_size);
 *     if (new_arr != NULL) {
 *         arr = new_arr;
 *     } else {
 *         // Handle failure, arr is still valid
